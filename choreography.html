            Leslie Satin writes: My choreography is best reflected in the title
            of a piece I made in 2016, <em>Things Hanging in the Air</em>. These
            words are borrowed from anthropologist Kathleen Stewart, whose
            writing conveys the sense of affect, of feelings, of knowing in a
            place and time: a day or a year or a fleeting moment. Making a
            dance, watching a dance, dancing, we experience movements that
            evolve or repeat or disappear, irrevocably changing the little
            world, the space and place, of the performance. As a choreographer,
            I am drawn to embodied ideas and experiences of space and place as
            they intersect with movement and stillness, with histories,
            memories, and imaginings which somehow&mdash;no matter how complex
            or fixed the dance&rsquo;s compositional score or the
            performers&rsquo; particularity&mdash;produce or permit something
            unexpected to take place in performance. I am moved in dance and in
            everyday life by the entwinement of the planned and the
            improvisational, and I work in that direction in my dance-making.
