          <p>
            Leslie Satin is a choreographer, dancer, writer, and teacher based
            in New York City. Her dances, interdisciplinary collaborations, and
            workshops have been presented at many venues in NYC (including Joyce
            SoHo, La MaMa E.T.C., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 92nd Street Y, The
            Performance Project @ University Settlement, Movement
            Research/Artists Space, Arts on Site, WeisAcres, Dixon Place,
            Triskelion, Construction Company), as well as elsewhere in the US,
            and in the UK, Brazil, and Israel. Her performances, workshops, and
            writing have been supported by residencies (Corporation of Yaddo,
            the Dragon&rsquo;s Egg), arts organizations (New Mexico Arts
            Division, Center for Contemporary Arts/Santa Fe, Railyard
            Performance Center/Santa Fe), and university grants (including New
            York University/Gallatin Jewish Studies).
          </p>
          <p>
            Satin has collaborated with many artists, including video artists
            Andrew Gurian and Ian Rosenkranz, composer/performance artist Connie
            Beckley, photographers Tom Brazil and Karen Robbins, composers Dan
            Evans Farkas and Roy Nathanson, dancers/writers Victoria Hunter and
            Claudia Brazzale, and, of course, the dancers in her choreography.
            She has worked with Billy Clark and CultureHub at La MaMa,
            conceiving and directing programs of telepresence-derived
            &ldquo;Distance Dances&rdquo; for students at New York University,
            Seoul Institute of the Arts (Korea), and the University of
            Chichester (England).
          </p>
          <p>
            Satin performed in many dances with Marjorie Gamso and the Energy
            Crisis Dance Company. She has appeared in the work of Meredith Monk,
            Jeremy Nelson/Luis Lara Malvacias, Sally Gross, Elaine Shipman,
            Einat Amir (PERFORMA 2013), Davide Balula (PERFORMA 2009), Yoshiko
            Chuma, Barbara Mahler, Pavel Zustiak, Despina Stamos, and others.
            She has appeared in the videos and photographs of visual artist
            Gabriela Vainsencher and video artist Andrew Gurian.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an undergraduate student, Satin studied composition and ballet
            with James Waring. After graduation, she began studying Cunningham
            Technique through the Merce Cunningham Trust; she continues that
            practice. She has also studied Klein Technique (with Barbara Mahler
            and Susan Klein) for many years. She has explored a range of
            contemporary/somatic movement practices, takes classes with Vicky
            Shick whenever possible, and periodically studies West African
            dance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satin is a longtime Arts Faculty member at the Gallatin School of
            New York University, where she teaches courses joining studio
            practice in dance and choreography with academic studies: dance and
            performance history, criticism, and theory. She has also taught at
            Bard College, Empire State University, and the Alvin Ailey American
            Dance Center/Fordham University, and has been a guest artist and
            lecturer at Princeton University, Barnard College, the University of
            Chichester (England), Hamidrasha (Israel), and Florida International
            University. Satin holds a Ph.D. and M.A. in Performance Studies
            (NYU).

            Satin&rsquo;s new book (Routledge 2024),
            <em>Dancing with Georges Perec: Embodying Oulipo</em>, considers the
            work of experimental 20th-century French writer Georges Perec from a
            dancer&rsquo;s perspective. This interdisciplinary work brings
            together art-making parallels and their individual and sociocultural
            contexts. It focuses on the relationship of Perec&rsquo;s writing to
            the ideas and practices of the Judson Dance Theater and the
            contemporary choreographers whose work extends its lineage, as well
            as to iconoclasts in other art forms. It addresses his writing as
            “ludic literature,” linked to the writerly “constraints” of Oulipo
            (<em>Ouvroir de Litt&eacute;rature Potentielle</em>, or Workshop for
            Potential Literature) and to other score-based compositional
            approaches across the arts. It addresses, too, Perec&rsquo;s having
            been orphaned as a small child by the Holocaust;
            <em>Dancing</em> situates his work historically and personally,
            linking it to his experiences of loss and his thoughts about
            Jewishness. Moreover, <em>Dancing</em> is framed as a performative
            autobiographical enactment of Satin&rsquo;s relationship to Perec, a
            convergence of textual, danced, remembered, and imagined selves.
