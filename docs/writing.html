          <p>
            Satin&apos;s writing engages a range of approaches to thinking about
            dance and to seeing dance as it intersects with other arts. Much of
            her recent work has explored the relationships of dance to the work
            of writer Georges Perec (who did not write about dance!). Other
            recent and earlier work has explored dance&apos;s interactions with
            autobiography, culture, ethnicity, and gender; social dance;
            historical and contemporary post-modern dance; mediated, historical,
            and embodied memory; site-based dance and performance; experiencing
            space and place; everyday culture, everyday bodies.
          </p>

          <h3>New Work</h3>
          <p>
            Satin&apos;s new book (Routledge 2024),
            <em>Dancing with Georges Perec: Embodying Oulipo</em>, considers the
            work of experimental 20th-century French writer Georges Perec from a
            dancer&apos;s perspective. It focuses on the relationship of
            Perec&apos;s writing to the ideas and practices of the Judson Dance
            Theater and the contemporary choreographers whose work extends its
            lineage, as well as to iconoclasts in other art forms. It addresses
            his writing as &ldquo;ludic literature,&rdquo; linked to the
            writerly &ldquo;constraints&rdquo; of Oulipo (<em
              >Ouvroir de Litt&eacute;rature Potentielle</em
            >, or Workshop for Potential Literature) and other writerly
            score-based compositional approaches. Perec was orphaned as a small
            child by the Holocaust; <em>Dancing</em>&nbsp;situates his work
            historically and personally, linking it to his experiences of loss
            and his thoughts about Jewishness.
