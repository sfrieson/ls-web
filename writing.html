          <p>
            Satin&apos;s writing engages a range of approaches to thinking about
            dance and to seeing dance as it intersects with other arts. Much of
            her recent work has explored the relationships of dance to the work
            of writer Georges Perec (who did not write about dance!). Other
            recent and earlier work has explored dance&apos;s interactions with
            autobiography, culture, ethnicity, and gender; social dance;
            historical and contemporary post-modern dance; mediated, historical,
            and embodied memory; site-based dance and performance; experiencing
            space and place; everyday culture, everyday bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satin&apos;s performance texts and writings on dance and performance
            appear in numerous journals, including

          <h3>New Work</h3>
          <p>
            Satin&rsquo;s new book (Routledge 2024),
            <em>Dancing with Georges Perec: Embodying Oulipo</em>, considers the
            work of experimental 20th-century French writer Georges Perec from a
            dancer&rsquo;s perspective. This interdisciplinary work brings
            together art-making parallels and their individual and sociocultural
            contexts. It focuses on the relationship of Perec&rsquo;s writing to
            the ideas and practices of the Judson Dance Theater and the
            contemporary choreographers whose work extends its lineage, as well
            as to iconoclasts in other art forms. It addresses his writing as
            “ludic literature,” linked to the writerly “constraints” of Oulipo
            (<em>Ouvroir de Litt&eacute;rature Potentielle</em>, or Workshop for
            Potential Literature) and to other score-based compositional
            approaches across the arts. It addresses, too, Perec&rsquo;s having
            been orphaned as a small child by the Holocaust; Dancing situates
            his work historically and personally, linking it to his experiences
            of loss and his thoughts about Jewishness. Moreover, Dancing is
            framed as a performative autobiographical enactment of Satin&rsquo;s
            relationship to Perec, a convergence of textual, danced, remembered,
            and imagined selves.

            Responses to <em>Dancing with Georges Perec: Embodying Oulipo</em>
          </h3>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Leslie Satin, dancer and dance scholar, deftly claims Georges
            Perec for the dance world. She invites him into her own family
            history as she imagines herself &lsquo;dancing with Georges
            Perec.&rsquo; Her recollections of Perec&rsquo;s significant
            presence in her own path through a dancing life ranges from
            aspirational flights of fancy to embodied experiences with
            Perec&rsquo;s ideas writ large, all through the lens of postmodern
            dance. Satin&rsquo;s scholarship and analysis of Perec is deeply
            rooted in an interdisciplinary framework, while her prose
            metaphorically dances across time and the pages of this timely
            text.&rdquo;<br />

            &ldquo;<em>Dancing with Georges Perec</em> is an examination of the
            work of an experimental French writer and his choreographic
            contemporaries in New York City. Leslie Satin has created an
            imaginative and personal work that brings them together, though
            neither culture had probably ever heard of the other. A fascinating
            enterprise.&rdquo;<br />

          <p>
            &ldquo;Across his novels, essays, and place-based writings, Georges
            Perec radically expanded our understanding of how we inhabit and
            interact with everyday spaces. His work foregrounds questions of
            embodiment, in both historical and relational terms, and proposes
            experimental forms of engagement with the world in which we dwell.
            Perec&rsquo;s influence is increasingly evident across multiple
            disciplines and fields of creative practice. In this welcome
            exploration of the intersections of Perec&rsquo;s writing with
            dance, Leslie Satin urges us to consider his oeuvre in new ways
            while exploring its implications for embodied performance more
            broadly.&rdquo;<br />
